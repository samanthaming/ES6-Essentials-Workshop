# ES6 Only the Essentials Workshop

Welcome! This workshop I introduce some of the most important part of the new ES6 syntax to get you up and running ü§©

### Topics include:
1. Variables
2. String Methods
3. Template Strings
4. Restructuring
5. Spread
6. Parameter Improvements 
7. Enhanced Object Literals

### Who is the workshop for?

This workshop is great for those looking into a deeper dive into the most essential part of the ES6 syntax. I share a lot of different use cases and variations of the most common ES6 features. I don't cover everything, instead I cover topics that a Web Developer can apply right away and see instant benefits to their code. Yay üéâ

Please note: Some basic JavaScript would be helpful. But as long as you have some programming knowledge, I think you will be able to follow along just fine üëç
